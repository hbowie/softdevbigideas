Title: Stay Focused on the Creation of Working Software for Real People

This was a major message of the Agile movement, which opened its [Manifesto][am] with the words: "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it."

To a great deal, this was a reaction to the [Capability Maturity Model][cmm] era, which often overshadowed the actual act of software coding with an emphasis on maturity levels, key process areas, process documentation, generation of artifacts and production of metrics. 

The point here is that well-intentioned improvement efforts, whether initiated by management or by consultants, can all too easily prove a distraction to the actual production of working software to be used by real people, often to the detriment of everyone involved.
