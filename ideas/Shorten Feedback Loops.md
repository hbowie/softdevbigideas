Title: Shorten Feedback Loops

These can also be thought of as learning loops. Each loop should consist of [Plan-Do-Check-Act][pdca] steps.

Practices such as continuous build integration, automated testing, software prototyping, daily stand-up meetings, and short software delivery cycles are all variations on this theme.

Note that, in agile development, process feedback is considered during a retrospective, while product feedback is considered as part of a customer demo.

In waterfall style development, it can take the entire length of your project to obtain feedback on your product and your processes. Agile, on the other hand, states as its third [principle][beck-et-al-2001-p]:

> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

These shorter timescales allow for frequent, iterative learning about customer requirements and preferences, product successes and shortcomings, as well as processes, tools and methods.

<p>
The most powerful learning comes from direct experience. But what happens when we can no longer observe the consequences of our actions? Herein lies the core <em>learning dilemma</em> that confronts organizations:<em> we learn best from experience but we never directly experience the consequences of many of our most important decisions.</em> The most critical decisions made in organizations have systemwide consequences that stretch over years or decades.</p>
