Title: Automate Repetitive Tasks

Never forget the unique ability of software to perfectly repeat a set of tasks as often as desired, without deviation or omission. 

This is, of course, the core value proposition of software, and so might be thought obvious. 

As technology advances, though, new frontiers often open up to this idea, as with the practice of treating [Infrastructure as Code][iac].

When software developers combine this idea with the idea to [Use Things Already Known to Work][reuse], and then apply these ideas to their own tasks, it results in the principle [Don't repeat yourself][dry], abbreviated as DRY.
