Title: Plan Thoughtfully But Be Prepared for Change

Planning is an essential activity for any project, because it helps developers anticipate problems and prepare ways to address them. 

However, plans should never be regarded as written in stone. They are always works in progress, and always subject to further change. 

The [Agile Manifesto][am] expresses this idea by stating that its signatories value "responding to change over following a plan."
