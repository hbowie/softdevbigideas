Title: The Value of Software is Determined by its Customers

Although developers need to form ideas about what will be useful to a set of users before developing software, those ideas can never be fully validated without actually developing the software and seeing what real users actually do with it.

This is one reason why [usability testing][ut] is so important.

> You [the software developer] will need humility to recognize that the users are always the final and most appropriate judges of your work. Even though you're the expert in interpreting your users' comments and meeting their needs, their judgments of your work are final and without appeal.
