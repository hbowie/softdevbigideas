Title: The Value of Software is Determined by its Customers

It is not enough to develop software that reliably performs a given task: the software must also be easy and reasonably pleasant to use.  This is more than just a matter of "gussying up" the user interface -- the developer must understand how his users think, and communicate to them using words and graphics that are consistent and effective. Most fundamentally, the software must be built around a mental model with which the user is already familiar, or that seems intuitive once learned.

Although developers need to form ideas about what will be useful to a set of users before developing software, those ideas can never be fully validated without actually developing the software and seeing what real users actually do with it.

This is one reason why [usability testing][ut] is so important.

In short, the software designer must learn to think like a communicator and to practice an artistic craft as well as an engineering one.</p>

You [the software developer] will need humility to recognize that the users are always the final and most appropriate judges of your work. Even though you&#8217;re the expert in interpreting your users&#8217; comments and meeting their needs, their judgments of your work are final and without appeal. </p>
