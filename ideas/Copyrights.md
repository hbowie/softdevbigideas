Throughout this work I frequently quote from other sources. My intent in so doing is never to damage the original copyright holder, but simply to make fair use of this material, for the purposes of criticism and analysis. In fact I provide liberal links from this site to the original sources. My consistent purpose is to promote the original works, and influence my readers to purchase them wherever possible.

If any author or copyright holder of any material used on this site feels that I am doing so unfairly, then please contact me as soon as possible via e-mail at <a href="mailto:bigkahuna@pagantuna.com">bigkahuna@pagantuna.com</a> and I will do my best to ensure fair use of the original material.
