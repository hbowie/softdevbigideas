Title: Make Problems Visible

Rather than hiding problems, or ignoring them in hopes they will go away, or waiting for someone else to discover them, it is best to make problems visible as quickly as possible, so that they can be resolved quickly, and so that any further rework can be minimized. 

The longer software problems fester, the more expensive they will be to solve, so it is best to address them early. 

This is one reason why code reviews, automated testing, user demos and frequent releases are all good ideas: all of these practices tend to make problems visible before they become more serious, and more difficult to rectify. 

Another benefit of early discovery of problems is that it is generally easier for team members at this point to understand how and why the problem occurred, and to figure out how to reduce the likelihood of similar problems in the future. 

Note that making problems visible is a central tenet of Lean, as indicated in this New York Times article from 2007:

> "For Americans and anyone, it can be a shock to the system to be actually expected to make problems visible," said Ms. Newton, a 38-year-old Indiana native who joined Toyota after college 15 years ago and now works at the North American headquarters in Erlanger, Ky. "Other corporate environments tend to hide problems from bosses." 
>
> "Mutual ownership of problems," is one slogan. Other tenets include "genchi genbutsu," or solving problems at the source instead of behind desks, and the "kaizen mind," an unending sense of crisis behind the company's constant drive to improve. 
>
> …some executives like Mr. Konishi complain of managers at Toyota factories who have not adhered to some of the company's most basic creeds, like allowing workers to stop factory lines when they spot defects. Empowering factory workers has long been central to Toyota's quality control.

As indicated in this quotation, people will not make problems visible if this results in them being punished for making mistakes. In order to surface problems, the organizational culture must support mutual ownership of problems, and focus on fixing the problem rather than assigning blame.
