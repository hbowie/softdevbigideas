### Version 0.91 -- Sep 5, 2016

Added 'Plus Sign Buttons' to the home page so that readers can optionally view the ideas within each section from this page. Also modified idea numbering to always show a single set of sequential numbers, rather than numbers starting over from 1 within each section index.

### Version 0.90 -- Aug 31, 2016

Soft launch. Ready for review and initial comments.
