Title: Increase Developer Engagement

[Daniel Pink][pink-2009] has done a great job of explaining why paying attention to the three motivating factors of autonomy, mastery and purpose can increase the performance of workers whose tasks require conceptual, creative thinking.

A compelling [product vision][vision] can help provide developers with a sense of purpose.

A [growth opportunity][growth] can provide an increased sense of mastery.

And a high level of autonomy can often be achieved through the implementation of right-sized, self-organizing [teams][] formed so as to implement [tight cohesion][cohesion] and [loose coupling][coupling].

The [Graphing Calculator Story][calc] provides a great example of what developers can accomplish when they can gain access to these three motivating factors.

Traditional rigorous methodologies, and software engineering in general, focus on architecture, requirements and design; coding and testing are considered low-value &#8216;construction&#8217; activities. In these methodologies, the high-leverage activities are the up-front activities. Agilists reverse this emphasis.</p>
