Title: Increase Developer Engagement

[Daniel Pink][pink] has done a great job of explaining why paying attention to the three motivating factors of autonomy, mastery and purpose can increase the performance of workers whose tasks require conceptual, creative thinking.  

A compelling [product vision][vision] can help provide developers with a sense of purpose. 

A [growth opportunity][growth] can provide an increased sense of mastery. 

And a high level of autonomy can often be achieved through the implementation of right-sized, self-organizing [teams][] formed so as to implement [tight cohesion][cohesion] and [loose coupling][coupling]. 

The [Graphing Calculator Story][calc] provides a great example of what developers can accomplish when they can gain access to these three motivating factors.
