Title: Communicate Clearly

The speed, efficiency and effectiveness of communication is all-important on a software development effort of any significant size.

Consider the following factors:

1. Signal-to-noise ratio: this is the ratio of useful information to the overall volume of information in a particular communication, or communication channel. Many developers, for example, find their incoming e-mail to have such a low percentage of signal that they abandon it altogether, except when pressed to dredge some particular nugget up out of the sea of dreck that is their inbox.

	So make sure that your team communications are rich with important information, and light on administrivia and management-speak.

2. Warmth of communication types: As Alistair Cockburn has pointed out in his <cite>Agile Software Development</cite> Chapter 3 excerpt on "[Communicating, cooperating teams][cockburn-2001]," the effectiveness of communication generally increases as the warmth of the communication method increases, where two people working together at a whiteboard is at one extreme, and a number of people exchanging written information via pieces of paper is at the other end of the spectrum.

	It's best to use warmer methods for the most critical exchanges of information.

3. Customer communication: be sure to communicate regularly and proactively with your key project stakeholders, to avoid any surprises or misunderstanding.

4. Storage and retrieval of project documents: many projects rely on PowerPoint presentations stored in multiple places, exchanged via e-mail, with no easy way to find the latest version of a particular piece of information when you need it. Instead, try to emulate a site like Wikipedia.
