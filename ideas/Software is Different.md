Title: Software is Different

It is often tempting, and sometimes helpful, to apply to software development lessons learned from other human activities.

One such activity is manufacturing. After all, can't we think of making software as a sort of assembly line?

However, this analogy can only be taken so far.

1. The goal of software development is to develop something new (to create meaningful variation), while the goal of manufacturing is to build the same thing over and over again (to minimize or eliminate variation). In software development, we never build the same product more than once. One implication of this fact is that it is much less meaningful to separate design from construction in software development. In hardware development, it is absolutely essential to create detailed product design models and documents from which physical products can be reliably and repeatedly manufactured. However, since we are only ever building one instance of any detailed software design, there are diminishing returns for increasing levels of detail in software design documentation. And so the software code actually becomes the detailed design documentation.

2. There is no physical material involved, so there is no need for material transformation from one form to another, and no need for material transportation from one location to another. In fact, the only thing flowing through the software development process is information. And, unlike material, information can be in two or more places at the same time, and can flow in multiple directions concurrently.

3. Because there is no need to order raw material or components to feed a physical assembly line, there is no natural "gate" between design and construction, as there is with physical products.

4. Software is more malleable than other types of products. And so, while there are rework costs, the "measure twice, cut once" approach is less relevant to software than it is to hardware. And software is often able to evolve more quickly than physical products.

<p>
The desire to treat software more like its hardware siblings began in earnest in the 1960s. Equal treatment was one motivation, at least at the start, but it was also an effort to make programming a more structured discipline like hardware engineering. Looking back, [David] Sayre observed that the Bald Peak conference had the regrettable effect of beginning a management mentality that served to &#8220;rigidify&#8221; programming at IBM. In the early days, he recalled that programming at IBM had an informal Silicon Valley flavor, which tended to encourage innovation. By the late 1960s, the working environment had become much more regimented. The disciplines of hardware engineering fit uneasily in the more ethereal realm of software. &#8220;Software is a much more plastic object than hardware,&#8221; Sayre said. &#8220;You whip it up, squeeze it, and you can dream.&#8221;</p>
