Title: Software Developers Are Not Interchangeable

Aptitude, skills and experience all make a difference. Order-of-magnitude differences in productivity levels have been well documented.

This is one reason why, as Fred Brooks pointed out long ago in the "Mythical Man-Month," estimates for software development can be entirely misleading.

Software developers are all different, and different along many different dimensions. Here are some of the ways in which they differ:

* Aptitude -- Some developers are simply more capable than others. Productivity differences of an order of magnitude have been documented on multiple occasions.

* General Experience -- Some developers have had deeper and broader software development experiences than others. This often correlates to years in the field, but then, when comparing developers, we sometimes find that, whereas developer A has had 20 years of experience, developer B has had the same year of experience 20 times. Successful experiences are also often much more helpful than the other kind, since developers will tend to repeat practices that they have used before, whether they were successful or not.

* Particular Skills and Experience -- Some developers may have background in a certain problem domain, or knowledge of a particular technology.

* Verbal and Written Communications Skills -- Some developers are good at communicating with customers, teammates and/or leaders, while others lack these skills. And some are good at communicating verbally, while others are better at communicating using the written word.

* Productivity -- Some developers seem to get things done, no matter what challenges they run into, while others seem to be easily sidetracked and tend to lose track of goals and commitments.

* Teaming -- Some developers play well with others, while some tend to operate more independently.

When considering these differences, it's good to be somewhat familiar with the [Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition][dreyfus], since experts often behave very differently than beginners when it comes to their tolerance/need for rigid rules.

It's also good to consider these differences when forming a team. You generally will want a good mix of skills and experience, and you will want teammates who can work together.

Counterintuitively, employees already performing above average have the greatest room for growth. Great managers also know that it is hard work helping a talented person hone his talents. If a manager is preoccupied by the burden of transforming strugglers into survivors by helping them squeak above average, he will have little time left over for the truly difficult work of guiding the good towards the great.</p>
