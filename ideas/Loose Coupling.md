Title:  Loose Coupling

When performing decomposition, it is best to group elements so as to minimize coupling between groups. 

Coupling can be thought of as communication between groups, or knowledge of what's going on within other groups, or dependencies of one group on another. 

Loose coupling tends to maximize the freedom of each group to handle its own work without consideration for what's going on in other groups. 

Note that loose coupling is desirable, whether the groups under consideration are teams of developers, or packages of data and methods. 

within agile, this idea results in the formation of relatively small, self-managed teams that contain all the resources they need to work relatively independently.
