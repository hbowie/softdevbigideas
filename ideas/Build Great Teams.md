Title: Build Great Teams

Software development is by its nature a particularly solitary activity. Much of the work involves one programmer, one keyboard and one computer. And the quality and quantity of the work being done in this way is often hard to observe directly.

This is one reason why [Watts Humphrey][wh] commented:

> Trying to change the behavior of software engineers is like herding cats. They are very independent people; they all have their own ideas, and they won't tell you what they think, particularly if they disagree with you. They just do what they want to do.

And so it is often difficult for even the best-intentioned managers and coaches to influence the working habits of individual developers.

It turns out, however, that there is a better way.

1. Organize developers into teams.
2. Decompose larger pieces of work into smaller, more manageable pieces.
3. Deliver working software in short, regularly timed development cycles.
4. Encourage joint ownership of software code, and joint responsibility for team results.
5. Have the team jointly define a set of common expectations about what it means for a developer to say that their work on a task is "done."
6. Bring the developers together briefly on a daily basis to talk about their work, their accomplishments and their challenges.
7. Allow the team to figure out how to best manage its work in order to meet its commitments.
8. Give the team access to a coach who can point out ways in which the team can improve its performance.

Teams like this can be largely self-managing, and will define and implement team norms more effectively than would be possible by intervention of a manager or a standards group.

Note that a software development team organized in this fashion has many similarities to a [lean manufacturing cell][cell].

> No man is more important than The Team. No coach is more important than The Team. The Team, The Team, The Team, and if we think that way, all of us, everything that you do, you take into consideration what effect does it have on my Team? We're gonna believe in each other, we're not gonna criticize each other, we're not gonna talk about each other, we're gonna encourage each other.
