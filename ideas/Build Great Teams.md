Title: Build Great Teams

Software development is by its nature a particularly solitary activity. Much of the work involves one programmer, one keyboard and one computer. And the quality and quantity of the work being done in this way is often hard to observe directly.

This is one reason why [Watts Humphrey][wh] commented:

> Trying to change the behavior of software engineers is like herding cats. They are very independent people; they all have their own ideas, and they won't tell you what they think, particularly if they disagree with you. They just do what they want to do.

And so it is often difficult for even the best-intentioned managers and coaches to influence the working habits of individual developers.

It turns out, however, that there is a better way.

1. Organize developers into mid-sized teams, with somewhere around 8 - 12 devs per team.
2. Decompose larger pieces of work into smaller, more manageable pieces.
3. Remember to apply the ideas of [Cohesion][cohesion] and [Loose Coupling][loose] when forming teams.
4. Give each team line-of-sight access to its key customers, including clear channels of communication, rapid, unambiguous feedback, and availability.
5. Deliver working software in short, regularly timed development cycles.
6. Encourage joint ownership of software code, and joint responsibility for team results.
7. Have the team jointly define a set of common expectations about what it means for a developer to say that their work on a task is "done."
8. Give each team the resources it needs to succeed: tools, skills, training, outside consulting and the necessary hardware and software infrastructure.
9. Bring the developers together briefly on a daily basis to talk about their work, their accomplishments and their challenges.
10. Allow the team to figure out how to best manage its work in order to meet its commitments.
11. Give the team access to a coach who can point out ways in which the team can improve its performance.

These sorts of teams have wonderful qualities. People learn from each other. People challenge each other. Communication tends to happen quickly and effectively. The teams organize themselves in order to get their work done most effectively. Performance standards tend to be embraced and enforced by the teams themselves, in a much more effective way than would ever be possible through the intervention of management or a central process group.

Note that a software development team organized in this fashion has many similarities to a [lean manufacturing cell][cell].

When assembling and managing such teams, it's important to consider the role of diversity. Research has demonstrated that teams with diverse perspectives and backgrounds tend to produce better results, even if the discussions within such a team tend to be a bit messier and less straightforward.

<p>
In one of our studies, we compared homogeneous and diverse groups trying to solve a murder mystery. The diverse groups reported that they didn&#8217;t work together very effectively, and they were less confident about their decisions than the homogeneous groups, yet they consistently outperformed those homogeneous groups.</p>

<p>
As a manager, you are responsible for making great decisions and the best way to do that is to involve as much of the team as possible in every decision. </p>

<p>
Your team is collectively smarter than you simply because there are more of them. More importantly, by including them in the decision process and creating a team where they feel they can say no, you&#8217;re creating trust.</p>

<p>
With smaller teams doing more for less, removing yourself from the code strikes me as a bad career move. Even in a monstrous company laded with policy, process, and politics, you can&#8217;t forget how to develop software. And how to develop software is changing. Now. Right under your feet, this very second. </p>

<p>
How in the world are you going to scale if you&#8217;re slowly forgetting how software is made? </p>

<p>
I&#8217;m happy you&#8217;re about to confuse your team by swimming in the developer pool. The simple fact is that well-defined roles in software development are fading. </p>

<p>
Everybody is talking to everybody else and they&#8217;re learning from each other&#8217;s mistakes ... and there&#8217;s no reason that a manager shouldn&#8217;t be participating in this massive global cross-pollination.... </p>

<p>
Besides, you want to be a part of a team of interchangeable parts. Not only does this make your team more nimble, it presents each person with the opportunity to see the product and the company from a vastly different perspective.</p>

Prior to Steve Jobs&#8217; return to Apple, there was a decent centralized usability team equipped with those fancy rooms with one-way mirrors and video cameras. I&#8217;m certain these folks did significant work, but when Jobs returned, he shut it down and he cast the design teams to the wind. Each product team inherited part of the former usability team. </p>

<p>
Now, I arrived after this reorganization occurred, so I don&#8217;t know the actual reasoning, but I do know I never saw those usability labs used once and I would argue that in the past decade Apple has created some of the most usable products out there. My opinion is that the choice to spread the usability design function across the engineering team was intended to send a clear message: engineer and designer need to party moreâ€¦ together. </p>

<p>
I can&#8217;t imagine building a team responsible for consumer products where engineers and designers weren&#8217;t constantly meddling in each other&#8217;s business. Yes, they often argue from completely opposite sides of the brain. Yes, it is often a battle of art and science, but engineering and design want exactly the same thing. They want the intense satisfaction of knowing they successfully built something that matters.</p>

The Team, The Team, The Team, and if we think that way, all of us, everything that you do, you take into consideration what effect does it have on my Team? We're gonna believe in each other, we're not gonna criticize each other, we're not gonna talk about each other, we're gonna encourage each other.
