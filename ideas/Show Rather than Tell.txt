Title: Show Rather than Tell

Language is a wonderful tool, but it is difficult for stakeholders to precisely parse large amounts of written text in order to provide reliable feedback on whether software developers are on the right track. 

On the other hand, diagrams, screen layouts, and prototypes are often easier for people to understand and respond to. 

This is not to say that words don't have their place. But interactive dialogue about a visual representation is often much more productive than shipping written text back and forth for review and approval.
