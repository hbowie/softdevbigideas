Title:  Quality Requires Extra Effort

Most software developers enjoy programming. And most software developers enjoy pleasing their customers. This means that, left to their own devices, developers will tend to focus on quickly delivering new features to their customers.

The problem here is that some attributes of high-quality software are not immediately visible to customers. And so, left to their own devices, many developers will tend to give short shrift to these quality factors.

This generally means that a project must exert some extra effort to ensure adequate levels of quality.

Such extra effort could include any or all of the following:

* peer reviews
* pair programming
* coding standards
* non-functional requirements (NFRs)
* code analysis tools
* automated tests
* dedicated testers
* defect metrics

Establishing the right sort of quality program for a project is a matter of judgment, though. There is no single set of quality practices that will be right for every project. What's right for one effort might be overkill for another.

Be careful as well to make sure that the practices you choose are actually effective. None of these practices should simply be implemented on faith, or because someone outside of the project says you should do them.

In general, even if developers don't all naturally follow such practices without some forethought and direction, a development team will happily accept such practices if they can see that they are resulting in better code being produced by the team. On the other hand, if a development team is dragging its feet and showing continued reluctance to follow some quality practices, this is generally an indication that the practices should be evaluated to see if they are really effective in achieving the project's desired quality goals at a reasonable cost.
