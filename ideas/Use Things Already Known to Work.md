Title: Use Things Already Known to Work

In other words, don't reinvent the wheel. 

This can also be thought of as reuse. But there are a number of different ways to state this.

1. Don't spend good money creating something new when something sufficiently similar already exists. 

2. Make use of patterns, algorithms, operating systems, APIs, services, database management systems, high-level languages, application frameworks, existing libraries and other building blocks that will help you focus on adding something new to the world, rather than simply recreating something that already exists. 

3. If you find yourself or your team doing repetitive work, then try to encapsulate the repeated actions into a module, class, framework or subroutine that can be used when needed, rather than simply doing the same mindless coding again. 

Use of things already known to work is a great way to increase both productivity and quality.
