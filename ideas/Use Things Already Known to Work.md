Title: Use Things Already Known to Work

In other words, don't reinvent the wheel.

This can also be thought of as reuse. But there are a number of different ways to state this.

1. Don't spend good money creating something new when something sufficiently similar already exists.

2. Make use of patterns, algorithms, operating systems, APIs, services, database management systems, high-level languages, application frameworks, existing libraries and other building blocks that will help you focus on adding something new to the world, rather than simply recreating something that already exists.

3. If you find yourself or your team doing repetitive work, then try to encapsulate the repeated actions into a module, class, framework or subroutine that can be used when needed, rather than simply doing the same mindless coding again.

Use of things already known to work is a great way to increase both productivity and quality.

Note that this idea can be applied at any level within a project.

At the governance level, this idea can be applied by using existing software rather than developing new software, including the idea of buying software rather than building new software.

At the design level, this idea can be applied by making use of existing application frameworks and component packages, rather than letting development teams "roll their own" solutions.

And at the execution level, this idea can be applied by ensuring that logic needed in more than one place is coded once by one team and made available as a reusable class, module or function.

The third &#8212; enormous &#8212; category lumps functional decomposition together with whacks on the side of the head, thinking outside the box, and all the others because, compared to the first two techniques, they are nearly worthless.</p>
