Title: Seek First to Understand Your Customer

It's important to start your development journey by understanding as much as you can about your customers: those you hope will find enough value in your product to be willing to exchange something else of value for the privilege of using it.

Here's a story that [James M. Morgan][jm] and [Jeffrey K. Liker][jl] tell in their 2006 book <cite>[The Toyota Product Development System: Integrating People, Process and Technology][morgan-liker-2006]</cite>:

> While developing Toyota's successful 2003 Sienna, the Sienna CE [Chief Engineer] drove his team in Toyota's previous minivan model more than 50,000 miles across North America through every part of Canada, the United States and Mexico. The CE experienced a visceral lesson in what is important to the North American minivan driver and discovered in every locale new opportunities for improving the current product.

This story illustrates a key point: often the best way to understand your customers is to spend time with them, walk a mile in their shoes (or type a day on their keyboard), listen to them, and observe their behaviors first-hand.

This doesn't mean that your customers can tell you exactly what they want, or that you can as a developer can slavishly ask for and obey their every request.

As [Henry Ford][hf] once said, "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."

<p>
Requirements are hard to understand and harder to specify. The wrong solution to this problem is to do a slipshod job of requirements specification, and rush ahead to design and code.... The right solution is to do whatever it takes to learn as many of the requirements as possible <em>now</em>. Do prototyping. Talk with more customers. Work for a month with a customer to get to know his or her job firsthand. Collect data. Do whatever it takes.</p>

If you do not pay enough attention to requirements, you endanger the project&#8217;s success by introducing too much risk. If you pay too much attention to requirements, you overburden the project and raise the likelihood of being late and over-budget.</p>

Furthermore, it is impossible for a consultant to walk into your office, examine a requirement, and tell you that it is either too detailed or too vague. The correct level of detail is completely dependent on the needs of the customer.</p>
