Title:  Introduction

I have been practicing software development for more than four decades now, and over that time, in addition to writing a lot of code, and being involved in a lot of projects in varying capacities, I've done a lot of reading on the topic. In fact, I have shelves full of books on the topic, starting with classics like <cite>[The Mythical Man Month][brooks]</cite>, proceeding through the CMM period and then on into the Lean/Agile years.
 
And, of course, the number of new words written on the topic increases daily.

How can a software developer keep up? 

I'm a firm believer that new ideas are generated from time to time, and that it is worthwhile to read about software development as well as to do it; on the other hand, I'm now at the point of wondering whether it wouldn't be possible to communicate the most important ideas about the field in a simpler, more concise, more easily accessible fashion. 

And so I am setting off to test my hypothesis by trying to document the Big Ideas in Software Development in a concrete, manageable, sequential list. I'll be creating, refining and enhancing this list in public, at SoftDevBigIdeas.org, and I welcome you to follow along as I progress, and to submit your own occasional suggestions for additions and refinements.

I look forward to your feedback.

## Notes 

Since I'm focused here on Software Development, ideas that are more broadly applicable to other types of product development will generally be stated in software-centric terms, although this is not meant to deny or devalue their broader applicability. 

Not all of these ideas are completely independent; in fact, they integrate with one another and interlock in an encouraging fashion. However, each different idea represents some unique piece of the puzzle not already stated or implicit elsewhere on the list.
