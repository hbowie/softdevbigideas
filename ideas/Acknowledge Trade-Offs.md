Title: Acknowledge Trade-Offs

All software development involves trade-offs. Trying to adhere to absolutes -- or to maximize one quality or performance factor while ignoring others -- will generally require you to pretend that these trade-offs don't exist, and sticking your head in this sort of sand is never a good idea. 

Instead, consider the impacts of these trade-offs in the context of your particular product vision, and make honest and open decisions about the degree to which you will pursue one attribute in favor of another.
