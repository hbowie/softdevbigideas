Title: Deliver Early and Often

The first [Principle behind the Agile Manifesto][principles] states 

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

One reason for this practice is to [shorten the feedback loop][feedback] so that the course of a development project can be altered based on actual responses from real usage in the field. 

Additionally, though, by delivering working software sooner, and delivering more often, customers receive increased value through earlier and longer enjoyment of the benefits delivered by the software. 

Another way of looking at this is through the lean concept of inventory as a form of waste. The more money we invest in software before delivering it to our customers, the more "inventory" we accumulate on the shelves of our "software warehouse," and inventory is a form of waste because it consumes resources without delivery of any value. 

Finally, short, regular delivery cycles tend to highlight problems inhibiting the rapid and easy flow of work through the value stream, and encourage improvements to the way that the work is done.
