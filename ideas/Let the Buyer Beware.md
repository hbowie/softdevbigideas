Title: Let the Buyer Beware

While there are certainly advantages to buying software rather than building it, buyers must be careful that the software they are acquiring is a good fit for their needs, and that that the long-term interests of the software supplier (whether commercial or open source) overlap sufficiently with the buyer's interests.

It&#8217;s far too rarely stated that the technology industry is not in the business of making people productive. It is only in the business of selling more technology. Granted, some companies make better tools than others, and users can be productive with some of today&#8217;s tools. But in the technology business, users&#8217; productivity is secondary to profitability. No matter what a company claims, feature lists and upgrades are designed for the company&#8217;s success, not the users&#8217;.</p>
