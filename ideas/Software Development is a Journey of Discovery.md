Title: Software Development is a Journey of Discovery

We must always remember that the software development process, from beginning to end, is a journey of discovery. Our intent is always to discover the big things early on, and have fewer and smaller surprises as we continue, but any omniscience we can claim is only in hindsight.

This is why attempts to arbitrarily "lock down" requirements or "freeze" a design are often ill-fated.

I must admit a certain bias here, but I think this is why English majors make particularly good software developers, for a software project is much more like a good novel than anything else.

Those who expect a development project to proceed in a straightforward, linear fashion generally find themselves frustrated, and ham-handed attempts to fit such work into a linear, predictable process often do more harm than good.

As in a novel, one generally starts by being introduced to a cast of characters: customers, managers, teammates. And, over the course of the developing story, we find out more about each: their perspectives, their biases, their interests. Over time, we piece all of this together into a coherent story that has a shared sense of meaning.

Along the way, of course, we have subplots, red herrings, surprises, suspense and mystery.

I don't suggest this analogy lightly.

Some people approach a software development project as if every last detail of the effort could be planned out far in advance, and then impose the expectation that such a plan must be exactly adhered to. When reality fails to meet the plan, they try to get "back on track," they seek out the deviant culprits who have failed to perform to plan, they pull out signed requirements documents as if they were binding contracts, and insist on cast-iron mitigation plans for all elements of risk.

Anything else, they think, would be chaos.

However, if we think about the experience of reading a novel, there are certainly surprises, uncertainty, ambiguity for much of the story -- but there is not chaos. Whether we think in terms of the classic three-act structure, or in terms of Joseph Campbell's outline of the Hero's Journey, there is a structure to the narrative and, although we can't predict in advance exactly what will happen on each page, any good novel does deliver a satisfying sense of progress as we proceed through it.

It is this sense of progress, I maintain, that is more important than the exact matching of dates and hours to a predetermined schedule.

A common misperception is that we must start with firm requirements. There is a widespread but fallacious view that requirements are the customers&#8217; job and that development should not start until they are explicitly defined. The fact is that the demand for firm and unchanging requirements is mostly wishful thinking....</p>
