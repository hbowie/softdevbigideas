Title: Pick the Right Sort of Customer Proxy

Index: customer proxy
Index: product owner

Body:

Nearly every development effort will require some individual or small group to make decisions on behalf of your customer. In Agile literature, this person would be referred to as the <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/" target="ref">Product Owner</a>. In other contexts, he or she might be referred to as the product manager, or the system manager, or simply a responsible business analyst.

Whatever they are called, this person or persons has a critical role to play, since they must ultimately make important decisions about what will be deemed acceptable and desirable and necessary by the broader customer community.

This person should:

* Be smart;
* Get things done;
* Be available to the development team on a daily basis;
* Have strong trust relationships within the customer community;
* Have good knowledge of user processes and expectations;
* Be willing to hold strong positions on topics, but be willing to change those positions based on new data and fresh input;
* Be comfortable making a decision, after a reasonable amount of time to gather data and other input on an issue;
* Be able to work collaboratively with technical leadership on the project,  realizing that reasonable trade-offs will be necessary, and that not all customer "requirements" can have equal priority;
* Be trusted by the technical team to ably represent the customer;
* Trust the technical team to bring appropriate technical expertise to the table when evaluating alternatives;
* Be strongly motivated to facilitate steady forward motion on the project.

There is no surer way to cripple a project than to designate a customer proxy who lacks one or more of these qualities.
