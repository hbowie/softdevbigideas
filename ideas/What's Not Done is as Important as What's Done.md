Title: What's Not Done is as Important as What's Done

Sometimes the stuff you leave out is as important as the stuff you put in. 

Adding low-value or even unnecessary features not only wastes money spent on development, but adds to the complexity of the resulting product, making it harder to use and harder to maintain over the entire span of its remaining life. 

This is another argument in favor of the short, frequent development iterations recommended by agile: each sprint requires decisions about what to put in and what to leave out, with the result that the most important features tend to get implemented earlier, and the less important ones later (or not at all).
