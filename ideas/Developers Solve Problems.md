Title: Developers Solve Problems

Any software development project can be thought of as a series of problems to be solved. [Planning][] can help a [team][] anticipate problems, but the discovery and solving of problems is a process that continues over the life of the project. 

As new problems are discovered, it is important to accept them as part of the work that needs to be done, rather than shooting the messengers who reported them, or trying to define the problems out of existence.

"Other corporate environments tend to hide problems from bosses."
