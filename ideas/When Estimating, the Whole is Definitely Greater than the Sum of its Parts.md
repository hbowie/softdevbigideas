Title: When Estimating, the Whole is Definitely Greater than the Sum of its Parts


Index: estimating

Body:

The time needed to complete an entire project will always be greater than the sum of the estimates for completing the individual tasks.

Why?

1. Some necessary tasks will not be included in your detailed estimates.

2. Estimates are usually based on the assumption that things will go well, and they often don't.

3. The time needed for communication and coordination is probably not included, and this work often increases exponentially as the entire project team size increases.

4. The time needed for requirements collection and analysis, design, testing and governance/compliance activities is often missing, or understated.

5. The time needed to bring new team members up to speed is often not included.
