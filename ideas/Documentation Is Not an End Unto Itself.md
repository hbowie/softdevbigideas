Title: Documentation Is Not an End Unto Itself

Documentation can be used to do one or more of the following: 

* help developers understand the work that needs to be done;
* help users figure out how the software works;
* help future developers maintain the software. 

In none of these cases should people rely on documentation as their only or even their best source of information: they will often be better served by reference to the software itself, either by seeing it in action, or -- in the case of developers -- by reference to the code itself, including comments embedded in the code.
