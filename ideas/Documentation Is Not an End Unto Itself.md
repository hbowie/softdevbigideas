Title: Documentation Is Not an End Unto Itself

Documentation can be used to do one or more of the following: 

* help developers understand the work that needs to be done;
* help users figure out how the software works;
* help future developers maintain the software. 

In none of these cases should people rely on documentation as their only or even their best source of information. Before the software is developed, face-to-face or at least real-time conversation with customers, architects and other team members will often be more effective than use of written documentation. After the software is written, people will often be better served by reference to the software itself, either by seeing it in action, or -- in the case of developers -- by reference to the code itself, including comments embedded in the code. 

The following forms of waste are all frequently associated with software documentation.

* Documents that are too long and dense for anyone to actually read. 
* Documentation that is too vague, imprecise or poorly written to be useful.
* Documents that might be useful, if only one could find them when they were needed. 
* Documentation that is not kept up-to-date, and so can be useless at best, and actively misleading at worst. 

Concise, well-written documentation can be useful, but one must remember that it is only a means to an end, and one must avoid the various common forms of waste listed above.
