Title: Documentation Is Not an End Unto Itself

Documentation can be used to do one or more of the following:

* help developers understand the work that needs to be done;
* help users figure out how the software works;
* help future developers maintain the software.

In none of these cases should people rely on documentation as their only or even their best source of information. Before the software is developed, face-to-face or at least real-time conversation with customers, architects and other team members will often be more effective than use of written documentation. After the software is written, people will often be better served by reference to the software itself, either by seeing it in action, or -- in the case of developers -- by reference to the code itself, including comments embedded in the code.

The following forms of waste are all frequently associated with software documentation.

* Documents that are too long and dense for anyone to actually read.
* Documentation that is too vague, imprecise or poorly written to be useful.
* Documents that might be useful, if only one could find them when they were needed.
* Documentation that is not kept up-to-date, and so can be useless at best, and actively misleading at worst.

Concise, well-written documentation can be useful, but one must remember that it is only a means to an end, and one must avoid the various common forms of waste listed above.

When you find a project team that is focused on producing a standard document rather than on considering the content of that document, then you are in the land of the template zombies.... </p>

<p>
In the land of the template zombies, form takes precedence. It is not necessary to think about the content of the document. It is not really necessary to think at all. The important thing is to have something&#8212;anything&#8212;under each of the prescribed headings. Not surprisingly, template zombies are adept in the art of cutting and pasting and ignoring anything that does not fit the dictates of the template.</p>

<p>
If you keep probing, and ask &#8216;Precisely what is in the document? What is it for? Who uses it to make which decisions?&#8217; then you discover that people do not know why. They are producing the document because it is the next thing to do. </p>

<p>
If you recognize this behavior on your project, you may be working in a paper mill. </p>

<p>
In a paper mill, every activity is marked by the production of a document, and progress is measured by how many of the documents have been produced&#8212;not by what the documents contain. The paper mill principle says: Just in case anyone needs anything, let&#8217;s give everbody everything.</p>

The bulleted list of requirements is by far the most cost-effective and beneficial approach. It is simple to create; it is simple to read, regardless of background; and, when stored in a spreadsheet, database, or requirements management tool and augmented with annotations, it has incredible benefits to project management.</p>
