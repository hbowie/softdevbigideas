Title: Consider Alternatives

Developers are often quick to use designs and patterns they are already familiar with, to try the first idea that occurs to them, and to persist with things that seem to be working.

However, the resulting product can often be made stronger through judicious consideration of alternatives early in the development process.

When generating alternatives, it's good to get input from a broad range of people with varying backgrounds and perspectives. These alternatives can then be vetted through discussion, research and, often, some degree of quick prototyping.

Morgan and Liker have described one such approach as "set-based concurrent engineering," and have pointed out that better and ultimately more workable designs are often developed by starting with broader sets of possible solutions, and then gradually converging on a final design.

Note that this approach requires a higher tolerance for a longer period of uncertainty early in the project, as alternative ideas are generated, evaluated and compared, but then results in less risk of having to rework the design late in the project, in order to accommodate issues that were not given sufficient consideration earlier.

Since this approach results in spending more design time up front, but then less time re-designing later in the project, it is sometimes referred to as "front loading the development process."

Of course, any consideration of alternatives will require open and spirited discussion of the pros and cons of each. Such discussions can get messy, but these sorts of discussions are absolutely essential in order to achieve the best possible results.

I never hesitated to promote someone I didn&#8217;t like. The comfortable assistant, the nice guy you like to go on fishing trips with, is a great pitfall. Instead I looked for those sharp, scratchy, harsh, almost unpleasant guys who see and tell you about things as they really are. If you can get enough of them around you and have patience enough to hear them out, there is no limit to where you can go.</p>

The typical, and primary, root cause of [the Nirvana] AntiPattern is the misguided notion that conflict is bad, and therefore should be avoided at all costs. In reality, conflict in the form of tension ... is a necessary part of any difficult task that involves intelligent people who care about their work.</p>

Jobs: What I do all day is meet with teams of people and work on ideas and solve problems to make new products, to make new marketing programs, whatever it is. </p>

<p>
Mossberg: And are people willing to tell you you&#8217;re wrong? </p>

<p>
Jobs: (laughs) Yeah. </p>

<p>
Mossberg: I mean, other than snarky journalists, I mean people that work forâ€¦ </p>

<p>
Jobs: Oh, yeah, no we have wonderful arguments. </p>

<p>
Mossberg: And do you win them all? </p>

<p>
Jobs: Oh no I wish I did. No, you see you can&#8217;t. If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to, you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy. The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don&#8217;t stay. </p>

<p>
Mossberg: But you must be more than a facilitator who runs meetings. You obviously contribute your own ideas. </p>

<p>
Jobs: I contribute ideas, sure. Why would I be there if I didn&#8217;t? </p>
