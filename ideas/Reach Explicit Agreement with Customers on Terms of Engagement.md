Title: Reach Explicit Agreement with Customers on Terms of Engagement

At the inception of any project, the development team and their customers should spend some time discussing and reviewing how they will work together over the course of the effort.

This may seem obvious, and yet in my experience development teams and their leaders often seem to take it for granted that their customers will readily fall in line with whatever approach they currently favor.

It is good to remember that your customers are not bit actors, to be handed a script and told to learn their lines, but your patrons, on whom you are heavily dependent if you are to enjoy any success at all.

All of the following factors are variables that should be discussed and explicitly negotiated with your customers.

1. Availability -- Who will be available, and how much time will they have?

2. Decision-making -- Who will be authorized to make various sorts of decisions, and will these decision-makers be individuals or boards?

3. Domain expertise -- Will customers expect developers to have some background in the problem domain being worked, or will customers bring all of that to the table?

4. Requirements precision -- Will customers be supplying precise requirements, to be followed to the letter? Or will they be describing general needs and desires, for the development team to use only as a starting point?

5. Testing -- What sort of testing and validation will customers be performing on the working software, and how much time will it take?

6. Timing -- At what points in the project will customers need to be available for what sorts of activities?

It's best to discuss all of these issues early on, and reach some documented agreement on how you and your customers will be working together over the course of the project.
