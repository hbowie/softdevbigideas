    <h1>Pick the Right Sort of Customer Proxy</h1>

<p>Nearly every development effort will require some individual or small group to make decisions on behalf of your customer. In Agile literature, this person would be referred to as the <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/" class="reflink" target="ref">Product Owner</a>. In other contexts, he or she might be referred to as the product manager, or the system manager, or simply a responsible business analyst.</p>
<p>Whatever they are called, this person or persons has a critical role to play, since they must ultimately make important decisions about what will be deemed acceptable and desirable and necessary by the broader customer community.</p>
<p>This person should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be smart;</li>
<li>Get things done;</li>
<li>Be available to the development team on a daily basis;</li>
<li>Have strong trust relationships within the customer community;</li>
<li>Have good knowledge of user processes and expectations;</li>
<li>Be willing to hold strong positions on topics, but be willing to change those positions based on new data and fresh input;</li>
<li>Be comfortable making a decision, after a reasonable amount of time to gather data and other input on an issue;</li>
<li>Be able to work collaboratively with technical leadership on the project,  realizing that reasonable trade-offs will be necessary, and that not all customer desires can have equal priority;</li>
<li>Be trusted by the technical team to reliably represent the customer&rsquo;s interests;</li>
<li>Trust the technical team to bring appropriate technical expertise to the table when evaluating alternatives;</li>
<li>Be strongly motivated to facilitate steady forward motion on the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no surer way to cripple a project than to designate a customer proxy who lacks one or more of these critical qualities.</p>
