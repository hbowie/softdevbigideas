    <h1>Loose Coupling</h1>

<p>When performing <a href="decomposition.html">decomposition</a>, it is best to group elements so as to minimize coupling between groups.</p>
<p>Coupling can be thought of as communication between groups, or knowledge of what&rsquo;s going on within other groups, or dependencies of one group on another.</p>
<p>Note that loose coupling is desirable, whether the groups under consideration are teams of developers, or packages of data and methods.</p>
<p>Loose coupling tends to maximize the freedom of each group to handle its own work without consideration for what&rsquo;s going on in other groups.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)" class="reflink" target="ref">Encapsulation</a> of data and internal components within objects is a notable feature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" class="reflink" target="ref">Object-Oriented Programming</a> (OOP), and is one means by which tight coupling between objects may be avoided.</p>
<p>Loose coupling frequently offers a way to make internal improvements to one object or group without necessitating concomitant changes to other objects/groups that communicate with the first, thus minimizing the &ldquo;ripple effects&rdquo; of changes.</p>
<p>When decomposing the staff of developers needed on large projects, the idea of loose coupling results in the formation of relatively small, self-managed <a href="build-great-teams.html">teams</a> that contain all the resources they need to work relatively independently.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle" class="reflink" target="ref">Postel’s Law</a> can be thought of as another means of supporting loose coupling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be conservative in what you do; be liberal in what you accept from others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This admonition, for both software interfaces and human ones, encourages us to stick to the straight and narrow in our own behavior, but be tolerant of minor quirks in others.
