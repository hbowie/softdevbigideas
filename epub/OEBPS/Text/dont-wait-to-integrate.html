    <h1>Don't Wait to Integrate</h1>

<p>Although developers can and should <a href="decomposition.html">decompose</a> large problems into a series of smaller ones, at some point they must integrate everything back into a single working whole.</p>
<p>Some experts recommend <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration" class="reflink" target="ref">Continuous Integration</a> (CI), but at the very least we can say that development teams should integrate sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Integration should include an integrated build of the entire system, and also testing of the integrated whole.</p>
<p>Integration of a system&rsquo;s components is an example of the &ldquo;check&rdquo; step in the <a href="plan-do-check-act.html">Plan-Do-Check-Act</a> cycle, and Continuous Integration (or something close to this extreme) should be considered an example of <a href="shorten-feedback-loops.html">shortening your feedback loops</a> and <a href="make-problems-visible.html">making problems visible</a>.</p>
<p>Projects that defer integration until late in their efforts almost always run into problems, and very often those problems are large enough to cause the project&rsquo;s implementation to be delayed, if not canceled altogether.</p>
