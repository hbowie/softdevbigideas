    <h1>Decomposition</h1>

<p>Large and complex things should be broken down into smaller, more manageable things. This can be done progressively, and recursively, at multiple levels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best if the number of things in each group is somewhere in the range of 3 - 15, with 7 being a sweet spot. The human brain seems fairly good at dealing with sets of this size.</p>
<p>This idea can be applied to system functionality, to software architectures, to work statements (where it results in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure" class="reflink" target="ref">work breakdown structure</a>), and to project staffing.</p>
<p>Decomposition is particularly powerful when done in conjunction with <a href="cohesion.html">Cohesion</a> and <a href="loose-coupling.html">Loose Coupling</a>.</p>
<p>One famous example of decomposition was performed by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/09/news/earliest-days-takeoff-how-the-wright-brothers-did-what-no-one-else-could.html?pagewanted=all" class="reflink" target="ref">Wright Brothers</a> when they broke down the problem of human flight into three separate domains: lift, control and propulsion.</p>
<p>Another common example of decomposition in modern web applications is evident in the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller" class="reflink" target="ref">MVC</a> pattern, in which application logic is subdivided into three separate areas: model, view and controller.</p>
<p>In Agile, it is common to have three levels of requirements decomposition, starting with <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/epic/" class="reflink" target="ref">epics</a>, proceeding to <a href="https://www.symphonious.net/2006/05/18/features-vs-stories/" class="reflink" target="ref">features</a>, and then to <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories" class="reflink" target="ref">user stories</a>.</p>
<p>Note, however, that detailed decomposition of requirements need not be done initially, and can often be profitably deferred until a feature is a high enough priority to be approaching scheduled implementation into code.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The bulleted list of requirements is by far the most cost-effective and beneficial approach. It is simple to create; it is simple to read, regardless of background; and, when stored in a spreadsheet, database, or requirements management tool and augmented with annotations, it has incredible benefits to project management.</p>
