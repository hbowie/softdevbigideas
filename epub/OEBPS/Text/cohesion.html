    <h1>Cohesion</h1>

<p>When performing decomposition, elements that are closely related to each other should be grouped together.</p>
<p>The relationships may be based on functional similarities, communication paths between elements, and/or interdependencies.</p>
<p>One test of cohesion is whether the function of a group can be easily described and understood, and whether the elements in that group can be seen to readily fit within that stated function.</p>
<p>Be careful, though, not to group elements together based on a shared or similar role, if each element is tasked to perform that role for different groups.</p>
<p>In other words, and in the case of development teams, you would not normally maximize cohesion by assigning each database analyst to a group of other database analysts, since the primary communication for each would be with the developers they are supporting, and not with other DBAs.</p>
<p>Instead, groups of individuals performing similar roles on different teams can best communicate with each other as members of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice" class="reflink" target="ref">Community of Practice</a>. Such a group may also be referred to as a guild.</p>
