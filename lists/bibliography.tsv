Freeman	Copyright	Keep Creating throughout the Construction Process	"<p> As it turns out, Gehry is concerned not with the precise angles or dimensions of a building, but with the emotional impression it instills in observers and inhabitants. The ability to convey this impression is elusive and fragile, he maintains, and can easily be lost in the neat, unambiguous precision of a two-dimensional drawing. </p> <p> To capture the building's intended emotional content, Gehry maintains, everyone working on the building should keep creating throughout the construction process. Withholding blueprints is a way of making sure that happens. Forgoing a detailed plan is disruptive it creates convolution, making a neat and well-defined process messy. </p>"	Eric Abrahamson and David H.

IBM has the best process people in the world. They just forgot about the content. And that's a little what happened at Apple too [which led to the Apple Lisa, a market failure in the 1980s]. We had a lot of people who were great at management process, they just didn't have a clue as to the content.

The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison. My own eyes are not enough for me, I will see through those of others. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, is not enough. I will see what others have invented. Even the eyes of all humanity are not enough. I regret that the brutes cannot write books.

The team leaders told us no one would be able to complete the whole job by the end of the month, but I was determined to prove them wrong. I was installing liners underneath the wheel well when my air gun slipped, and the driver bit scratched the paint on the inner lip of the wheel well. I gasped and looked around &#8212; no one saw me do it &#8212; but they had told me to pull the andon (rope) cord if I made or caught any defect. It was my moment of truth. My first reaction was to let it go. No one would probably see the scratch anyway, and no one would know that I made it. But my conscience got the best of me, and I wanted to see if the really meant what they said about admitting mistakes. So I pulled the andon and the team leader came to fix the problem and showed me how to hold the bit with a free finger in order to stabilize it better: But he did not seem angry at me for making the scratch. </p> <p> Then at break we gathered for our afternoon group meeting where the group leader gave out information on safety and quality issues and heard back concerns from the members. </p> <p> They spoke Japanese so I could not understand what they were saying until I heard the words, &#8220;Mike-san.&#8221; Well that got my attention so I listened carefully...more Japanese and then &#8220;scratchee scratchee&#8221; ...and then more Japanese. So here it was; finally I was going to get called out for messing up and they were going to do it in front of everyone. Then, all of a sudden, the whole group looked at me and clapped and smiled and patted my back and shook my hand as they headed back to the line. I couldn't believe it, after double checking with an interpreter just to make sure, they were applauding me because I made a mistake and admitted it. I felt like a million bucks, and guess what I did the next time I made a mistake? </p>"	McGraw-Hill				27-28	jeffrey-liker-and-michael-hoseus	Jeffrey_Liker_and_Michael_Hoseus	Jeffrey <strong>Liker</strong> and Michael <strong>Hoseus</strong>	"<a href='../tags/culture.html' rel='tag'>Culture</a>, <a href='../tags/lean.html' rel='tag'>Lean</a>, <a href='../tags/pagan-tuna.html' rel='tag'>Pagan Tuna</a>, <a href='../tags/practopian.html' rel='tag'>Practopian</a>"	"<a href='../wisdom/tags/culture.html' rel='tag'>Culture</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/lean.html' rel='tag'>Lean</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/pagan-tuna.html' rel='tag'>Pagan Tuna</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/practopian.html' rel='tag'>Practopian</a>"	"the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Toyota Culture: The Heart and Soul of The Toyota Way</cite>, <span class='city'>New York</span>: <span class='publisher'>McGraw-Hill</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2008</span>, pages&nbsp;<span class='pages'>27-28</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071492178/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>0071492178</a>"	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2008</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>McGraw-Hill</span>

When a design effort is complete, the design documentation is turned over to the manufacturing team. This is a completely different group with completely different skills from the design team. If the design documents truly represent a complete design, the manufacturing team can proceed to build the product. In fact, they can proceed to build lots of the product, all without any further intervention of the designers.

Bertrand Russell		The Celestial Teapot	"<p> Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of skeptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatics to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. </p>"						bertrand-russell	Bertrand_Russell	Bertrand <strong>Russell</strong>	"<a href='../tags/pagan-tuna.html' rel='tag'>Pagan Tuna</a>, <a href='../tags/practopian.html' rel='tag'>Practopian</a>, <a href='../tags/thought.html' rel='tag'>Thought</a>"	"<a href='../wisdom/tags/pagan-tuna.html' rel='tag'>Pagan Tuna</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/practopian.html' rel='tag'>Practopian</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/thought.html' rel='tag'>Thought</a>"	"the <span class='sourcetype'>Essay</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Is There A God?</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>1952</span>"

When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory. </p> <p> 5. Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found. </p> <p> 6. Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you. </p> <p> 7. Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric. </p> <p> 8. Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter. </p> <p> 9. Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it. </p> <p> 10.

It begins with the idea that work can be meaningful and stretches it to the point where there is no meaning outside work.

Preparing managers to manage, in fact, is not different from preparing people to live in a civilized world.

This is not the last word on the topic, but the first word, a simple list of suggestions to get the conversation going. Most of the great wisdom traditions agree that: </p> <p> 1. Spirit, by whatever name, exists. </p> <p> 2. Spirit, although existing out there, is found in here, or revealed within to the open heart and mind. </p> <p> 3. Most of us don't realize this Spirit within, however, because we are living in a world of sin, separation, or duality &#8212; that is, we are living in a fallen, illusory, or fragmented state. </p> <p> 4. There is a way out of this fallen state (of sin or illusion or disharmony), there is a Path to our liberation. </p> <p> 5. If we follow this Path to its conclusion, the result is a Rebirth or Enlightenment, a direct experience of Spirit within and without, a Supreme Liberation, which </p> <p> 6. marks the end of sin and suffering, and </p> <p> 7. manifests in social action of mercy and compassion on behalf of all sentient beings. </p> <p> Does a list something like that make sense to you? Because if there are these general spiritual patterns in the cosmos, at least wherever human beings appear, then this changes everything. You can be a practicing Christian and still agree with that list; you can be a practicing Neopagan and still agree with that list. </p>"	Ken Wilber	http://www.beliefnet.com/Wellness/2004/03/An-Integral-Spirituality.aspx				ken-wilber	Ken_Wilber	Ken <strong>Wilber</strong>	"<a href='../tags/innerview.html' rel='tag'>innerview</a>, <a href='../tags/practopian.html' rel='tag'>Practopian</a>, <a href='../tags/spirit.html' rel='tag'>spirit</a>"	"<a href='../wisdom/tags/innerview.html' rel='tag'>innerview</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/practopian.html' rel='tag'>Practopian</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/spirit.html' rel='tag'>spirit</a>"	"the <span class='sourcetype'>Essay</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Beliefnet</cite>, <cite class='minortitle'>&#8220;An Integral Spirituality&#8221;</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>2004</span>"	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2004</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Ken Wilber</span>

If we look at moral development, for example, we find that an infant at birth has not yet been socialized into the culture's ethics and conventions: this is called the <strong>preconventional stage</strong>. It is also called <strong>egocentric</strong>, in that the infant's awareness is largely self-absorbed. But as the young child begins to learns its culture's rules and norms, it grows into the <strong>conventional stage</strong> of morals. This stage is also called <strong>ethnocentric</strong>, in that it centers on the child's particular group, tribe, clan, or nation, and it therefore tends to exclude those not of its group. But at the next major stage of moral development, the <strong>postconventional stage</strong>, the individual's identity expands once again, this time to include a care and concern for all peoples, regardless of race, color, sex or creed, which is why this stage is also called <strong>worldcentric</strong>. </p> <p> Thus, moral development tends to move from &#8216;me&#8217; (egocentric) to &#8216;us&#8217; (ethnocentric) to &#8216;all of us&#8217; (worldcentric)&#8212;a good example of the unfolding waves of consciousness. </p>"	Ken Wilber				34	ken-wilber	Ken_Wilber	Ken <strong>Wilber</strong>	"<a href='../tags/integral-approach.html' rel='tag'>Integral Approach</a>, <a href='../tags/pagan-tuna.html' rel='tag'>Pagan Tuna</a>, <a href='../tags/practopian.html' rel='tag'>Practopian</a>"	"<a href='../wisdom/tags/integral-approach.html' rel='tag'>Integral Approach</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/pagan-tuna.html' rel='tag'>Pagan Tuna</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/practopian.html' rel='tag'>Practopian</a>"	"the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>the integral vision</cite>, <span class='city'>Boston &amp;amp; London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Shambhala</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2007</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>34</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590304756/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1590304756</a>"	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2007</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Ken Wilber</span>

It is the internalization of moral principles of a society, augmented by those tenets personally chosen by the individual, strong enough to endure through trials of solitude and adversity. The principles are fitted together into what we call integrity, literally the integrated self, wherein personal decisions feel good and true. Character is in turn the enduring source of virtue. It stands by itself and excites admiration in others. It is not obedience to authority, and while it is often consistent with and reinforced by religious belief, it is not piety. </p>"						e-o-wilson	E._O._Wilson	E.
